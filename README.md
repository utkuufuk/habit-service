[![CI](https://github.com/utkuufuk/habit-service/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/utkuufuk/habit-service/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Habit service for [entrello](https://github.com/utkuufuk/entrello), built on top of Google Sheets.

## Spreadsheet Format
You must have a dedicated sheet for the current month in your spreadsheet.

_Do not delete sheets for old months as they may be used by the progress report feature._

Sheet names must follow this specific convention:
```sh
# first 3 letters of the month (first letter capitalized) followed by 4-digit year

# examples:
Sep 2022
Jun 2023
May 2024
```

The sheet format must follow this specific convention:
- Dates go to the first column, starting from `A3`. (Leave `A1` and `A2` blank.)
- Habit names go to the first row, starting from `B1`.
- Completion percentages to the second row, starting from `B2`.
- There must be a row for each day in month (starting from row 3) and a column for each habit (starting from column B).

Here's an example:

_Conditional formatting of the colors can be adjusted from Google Sheets UI._

## Usage
Start the server:
```sh
go run ./cmd/server
```

#### `GET <SERVER_URL>/entrello`
Fetch all habits that are not marked yet as done/skipped/failed.

[entrello](https://github.com/utkuufuk/entrello) will periodically call this endpoint and create a Trello card for each returned habit.

Alternatively, you can run following command to print the same result set on the console:
```sh
go run ./cmd/cli
```

#### `POST <SERVER_URL>/entrello`
Mark a habit as done/skipped/failed.

[entrello](https://github.com/utkuufuk/entrello) will call this endpoint whenever a habit card is archived on your Trello board.

#### `POST <SERVER_URL>/progress-report`
Generate and send a progress report as a Telegram message.

This endpoint will **not** be called by [entrello](https://github.com/utkuufuk/entrello). It's meant to be called by a separate scheduled job, or manually on demand. You don't have to put anything in the `POST`Â request body, but if you set the `SECRET` environment variable, you must also set the `X-API-Key` header accordingly.

Alternatively, you can run following command to generate and send a progress report:
```sh
go run ./cmd/cli progress-report
```

## Configuration
Put your environment variables in a file called `.env`, based on `.env.example`.

| Environment Variable | Description |
|-|-|
| `TIMEZONE_LOCATION`           | Timezone, e.g. `"Europe/Istanbul"` |
| `GSHEETS_CLIENT_ID`           | Google Sheets Client ID |
| `GSHEETS_CLIENT_SECRET`       | Google Sheets Client Secret |
| `GSHEETS_ACCESS_TOKEN`        | Google Sheets Access Token |
| `GSHEETS_REFRESH_TOKEN`       | Google Sheets Refresh Token |
| `SPREADSHEET_ID`              | Google Spreadsheet ID |
| `PORT`                        | HTTP port (server mode only) |
| `SECRET`                      | API secret (server mode only, optional) |
| `PROGRESS_REPORT_SKIP_LIST`   | Comma-separated habit names to be excluded from progress reports |
| `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`              | Telegram Bot API Token |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`            | Telegram Bot Chat ID |
